## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Agentic_Chatbots_RAGS: Multi-Mode AI Agent System with RAG Integration](https://github.com/bhanu1836/Agentic_Chatbots_RAGS)
> Agentic_Chatbots_RAGS is a multi-use-case AI system built with Groq-powered LLMs supporting three modes: Basic Chatbot, Web-integrated Chatbot, and AI News Summarizer.It offers a modular agentic workflow with clear pipelines for each use case.The project uses Streamlit for the frontend, open-source LLMs for processing, and RAG techniques for context-aware responses.Each workflow is designed for scalability, easy customization, and quick deployment. Ideal for building real-time, intelligent conversational agents for varied applications.

### 🔹 [🛒 ShopScout AI: Multi-Agent Smart Buyer](https://github.com/bhanu1836/Shop-scout-AI-Agent)
> ShopScout AI is a GenAI-powered product comparison tool built with multi-agent logic. You simply input a product name and budget, and the agent intelligently searches **Google Shopping (India)** using SerpAPI, filters valid products, and returns the **best available deals in INR (₹)** from popular stores like **Amazon.in** and **Flipkart**.


### 🔹 [Multi Language Invoice extractor](https://github.com/bhanu1836/multilanguage-invoice-extractor)
> A smart AI-powered web application that extracts key details from invoice images written in multiple languages using Google Gemini's multimodal model.

### 🔹 [agent-for-mysql-database](https://github.com/bhanu1836/agent-for-mysql-database)
> Built using LangChain and MySQL. A natural language query agent that intelligently fetches data from a MySQL database using LLMs.

### 🔹 [Text to Math Problem Solver Agent](https://github.com/bhanu1836/text-to-math-agent)
> A Python-based "text-to-math" agent that parses written arithmetic or algebra expressions in natural language and converts them into structured mathematical operations, leveraging modular tool-based pipelines (powered by LangChain). Users type something like “Compute the square of the sum of 3 and 4,” and the agent interprets that, maps it to a tool sequence, and returns the numeric result.

### 🔹 [search-engine-agent](https://github.com/bhanu1836/search-engine-agent)
> An intelligent multi-source search engine that uses LLMs to retrieve and summarize information from DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv.

### 🔹 [eye_disease_prediction_CNN](https://github.com/bhanu1836/eye_disease_prediction_CNN)
> CNN-based image classification system for detecting eye diseases. Includes a Flask-based web UI for user input and predictions.

### 🔹 [fruits-quality-prediction-using-CNN](https://github.com/bhanu1836/fruits-quality-prediction-using-CNN)
> CNN-based image classification system for predicting the quality (fresh/spoiled) of fruits. Includes a Streamlit-based web UI for uploading images and displaying predictions.

### 🔹 [Agent for YT and Web URL summarizer](https://github.com/bhanu1836/Agent-for-YT-WEB_URL-summarizer)
> This project focuses on building an intelligent multimodal summarization agent capable of extracting and condensing information from both YouTube videos and web pages (URLs) using the power of large language models (LLMs).

###  🔹[Image caption Generator](https://github.com/bhanu1836/image_caption_generator)
> This project focuses on building a vision-language model pipeline that can generate accurate and context-aware captions for uploaded images. The system leverages deep learning to extract visual features from images and combines them with language models to produce descriptive, human-like captions.
